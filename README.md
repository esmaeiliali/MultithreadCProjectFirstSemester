# MultithreadCProjectFirstSemester

In this project I created the software for a library with certain specifications. //
This software is in command prompt mode and the user will enter data based his or her needs. 
I used two threads for the program. One of them is for getting the input via the keyboard and mouse. 
The second one is for displaying the time on the head of the console application. 
Although the two threads are not perfectly in sync, the program tends to work with a good accuracy.
I also used tones and created welcome and goodbye messages with the beep sound and print command and for loops. 
This project was given to computer science/ computer engineering students during their first semester at Isfahan University of Technology.
The program is written in Farsi with a combination of English and I used text files as the databases for storing the books information, user information and etc.
